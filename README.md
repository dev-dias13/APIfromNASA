APIfromNASA - Simple example application with API data from NASA (https://data.nasa.gov/).
The project uses data from 2 catalogs: 
1) Meteorite Landings (https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh) 
2) Global Landslide Catalog Export (https://data.nasa.gov/Earth-Sciense/Global-Landslide-Catalog-Expert/dde9e-wu2v).

Meteorite Landings. This comprehensive data set from The Meteoritical Society contains information on all of the known meteorite landings. The Fusion Table is collected by Javier de la Torre and we've also provided an XLS file that consists of 34,513 meteorites and includes the following fields:
place
type_of_meteorite
mass_g
fell_found

Global Landslide Catalog Export. The Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was developed with the goal of identifying rainfall-triggered landslide events around the world, regardless of size, impacts or location. The GLC considers all types of mass movements triggered by rainfall, which have been reported in the media, disaster databases, scientific reports, or other sources.
